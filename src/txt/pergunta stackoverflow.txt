We are trying to blur the background image, but when we use "backdrop-filter: blur" at both classes at the same time, just one of them gets blurried

Here are the code:
```
.nav-container{
    backdrop-filter: blur(5px);
    position: fixed;
    z-index: 10000;
    width: 100%;
    background-color: var(--background-tp);
}

.nav-menu{
        backdrop-filter: blur(5px);
        display: grid;
        grid-template-columns: auto;
        background-color: black;
        margin: 0;
        width: 100%;
        position: absolute;
        top: 7vh;
        left: -100%;
        opacity: 0;
        transition: all .5s ease;
    }
```

When we remove "backdrop-filter: blur" from nav-container, the filter gets apllied only at the mobile menu. We are trying to make both navbar and mobile menu blurs the background at the same time.
